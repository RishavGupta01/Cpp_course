# C++ Course

This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals and advanced topics of C++ programming. You will learn how to write, compile, debug, and run C++ programs, as well as how to use features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exceptions, containers, algorithms, and more.

## Prerequisites

To take this course, you should have some prior knowledge of programming concepts and basic syntax. You should also have a C++ compiler and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed on your computer. Some recommended tools are:

- [GCC](^1^): A free and open source C++ compiler for Linux, Mac, and Windows.
- [Visual Studio Code](^2^): A lightweight and cross-platform code editor with C++ support and extensions.
- [Code::Blocks](^3^): A free and open source C++ IDE with a built-in compiler and debugger.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into 3 modules, each covering a different aspect of C++ programming. Each module consists of several lessons, quizzes, and projects to help you practice and apply your skills. The modules are:

- **Module 1(1st to ...): C++ Basics**: This module covers the basic syntax, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and arrays in C++. You will learn how to write simple C++ programs and use standard input and output streams.
- **Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming**: This module introduces the concepts of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, constructors, destructors, access specifiers, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes. You will learn how to design and implement your own classes and use them in your programs.
- **Module 3: Generic Programming**: This module explores the idea of generic programming, which allows you to write code that can work with different types of data. You will learn how to use templates, template functions, template classes, and template specialization. You will also learn how to use the standard template library (STL), which provides a collection of useful containers, iterators, algorithms, and functors.
